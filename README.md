# PiZtand
simple quick-printing configurable stand mount for Raspberry Pi Zero

Also fits BannannaPi M2 Zero and Radxa Zero.

M2.5 screws should screw reasonably tight right in the plastic with no nuts.

Screw the posts to the Pi Zero, then insert into one of the sets of post holes in the base.

Base has post holes to hold the tower vertical, or slanted at 15, 30, or 45 degrees.

Printing all parts at once requires 80x95mm build surface, and prints in under an hour at 0.3mm layer x 65mm/s.
